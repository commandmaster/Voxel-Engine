# Formating Rules
- Use Allman style braces and the visual studio c++ format standard
- Only comment code that is very confusing and comment infrequently
- all member variables and should follow camel case, as do methods and functions
- classes should have public members and methods first then private ones
- macros and constexpr variables should be all uppercase with a _ in between words
