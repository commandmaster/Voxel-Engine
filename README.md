# Custom Voxel Engine 
- Voxel engine in C++ built on top of the Vulkan graphics API using the hardware-accelerated ray tracing pipeline that runs using the RT cores on modern GPUs. 
- The project is to help learn graphics programming and vulkan - my first graphics api.
- The end goal is to have scriptable games in the engine.
